- 👋 Hey there, I'm Chip
- 👀 I'm an Engineering Manager looking for a new place to Manage Engineers. I have a linkedIn thing at https://www.linkedin.com/in/chip-harlan/
- 🌱 Most of the things here are little projects I've been tinkering with in my spare time, so they're not fully fleshed out
- 📫 I'm on dischord if you need to reach me
