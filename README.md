Hey there, I'm Chip

I'm an Engineering Manager looking for a new place to Manage Engineers. I have a linkedIn thing at https://www.linkedin.com/in/chip-harlan/

Most of the work I've done here at GitHub is hidden by private company filters. The things you can see here are little projects I've been tinkering with in my spare time, so they're not fully fleshed out.

I'm on dischord if you want to contact me
