Hey there, I'm Chip

I'm an Engineering Manager. I have a linkedIn thing at https://www.linkedin.com/in/chip-harlan/

Most of the work I've done here at GitHub is hidden by private company filters. The things you can see here are little projects I've been tinkering with in my spare time, so they're not fully fleshed out, but give them a try anyway!

* An attempt to reverse-engineer and localize [11Alive's Wizometer](https://www.11alive.com/weather) at https://chippenzie.github.io/wizometer/build/
* An attempt to organize archive.org's old radio broadcasts to listen to at https://chippenzie.github.io/wayback-hifi/build/
